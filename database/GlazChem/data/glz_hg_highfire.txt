Nicecolonial (bluish slate) over white slip Well I finally got around totyping this thing up...^9-10 Blues Thank you one and all for all thedonated recipes. I only tested 31 out of almost 100 I received. I'llcontinue testing and reporting as the winter DRAGS on. All the glazeswere tested on #900 Miller clay which is a toasty ^10 stoneware. Oneside of the test tile was brushed with a thick coating of CynthiaBringle's wet/dry white slip. Each glaze was dipped in threethicknesses on a heavily textured tile. All tiles were fired to a(hard)^9 (10 tipping)reduction firing. 1 hr. Body reduction at ^08and 1 hr. glaze reduction at ^9 then a quick reox. before shutdown.Any time potash or Custer spar is called for, I used G-200. All ballclay is OM-4 . Many glazes I substituted 75% of the amount of Bariumwith Strontium. All kaolin is EPK. Remember... glazes don't travelwell. Your results will probably be TOTALLY different. Please testbefore use.

Kevin O'Hara asked about a reliable base formula foran ash glaze. We have been using the glaze base provided by HaroldMcWhinnie in his November 1986 'Ceramics Monthly' article (AMultipurpose Glaze, p. 75). We repeat it below. If you have anyquestions about this glaze, we believe that Harold is now monitoringthe Clayart list regularly. We have experimented with various typesof wood ash. We now use pecan hull ash. Fortunately, we have manypecan trees in the area along with cracking plants that kindly supplyus with the hulls. There is a lot of oil in pecan hulls (includingmany nuts) so they burn hot with very little but fine ash. We do notwash this ash; however, we have found that we must wash other woodash. We experimented with Victoria's Secret ash (burned their ceaselycatalogs) but found it full of trash and required cleaning.

These are not super long firings -in the 14-18 hourrange, so a lot of the surface effect comes from the salt rather thanfrom a lot of ash. I have also used it in salt/soda and it lookedgreat-more orange than brown. I haven't used it with a real heavyload of salt but if you try it I'd like yo know how it looks. Mixjust a little on the thin side and its works on bisque just as wellas on geenware I've been working up some variations using Helmerkaolin, but haven't hit one I like yet.

They were fired to cone 10 Ox. buy my wife, LindaOwen, in her trusty Skutt Kiln. Thanx Linda! The two glazes arenearly identical. I didn't expect that, but ya never know. Theoriginal formula with gerstley borate has more calcium-borate-ironcrystals floating in the matrix but you really can't see this withouta hand lens. A customer who has purchased pots with the originalformula would be hard pressed to tell the difference. I feel likeI've just taken the Pepsi Challenge!! The tests were fired onporcelain. Four tiles were made of each glaze, eight in all and theseparate formulas were fired side by side in the top, middle, andbottom of the kiln. No significant differences were seen. I mightalso mention that I used English Bone Ash, and not Tri-Calcium Phos.All the tiles were inspected with a hand lens and no crazing wasevident in either formula. A separate set has been fired to cone 10 Rbut won't be available until tomorrow. That's about it for now,e-mail me or post to clayart if I've forgotten to mention anythin,and I probably have...it's my hobby! The formulas and receipes areposted below.

I think I'd rather have more RIO thanCobalt, due to cost, but it's hard to knock success, and it breaks toa nice blue when white is over it. -- Also, it wouldn't surprise me abit if the bone ash is superfluous The recent posts on foodsafe blackhave prompted me to state my own opinion on black glazes. I thinkblack glazes need not be avoided totally for foodware, but commonsense argues that some blacks are better than others. If the baseglaze doesn't leach harmful chemicals, then one must concentrate oncombinations of oxides to produce the color with the least toxicity.Though I've never seen an authoritative ordered list of nastychemicals, Red Iron Oxide, Cobalt Carb, and Copper Carb seem safer tome than Manganese Dioxide, Nickel, Cadmium, and Chrome. From an oldLaurel's Kitchen cookbook, I read that Iron, Copper, Zinc, Manganese,Cobalt, Chromium, Nickel, Tin, and even Vanadium are all traceminerals essential for animals. I assert that most glazes releasetraces at best of these minerals. However, we are caught in a worldwhich can measure in Parts per Billion, and all kinds of things looksignificant at that level. I sometimes wonder how long the ozoneholes at the poles existed before we had the means to ascertain theirexistence.

Oneside of the test tile was brushed with a thick coating of CynthiaBringle's wet/dry white slip. Each glaze was dipped in threethicknesses on a heavily textured tile. All tiles were fired to a(hard)^9 (10 tipping)reduction firing. 1 hr. Body reduction at ^08and 1 hr. glaze reduction at ^9 then a quick reox. before shutdown.Any time potash or Custer spar is called for, I used G-200. All ballclay is OM-4 . Many glazes I substituted 75% of the amount of Bariumwith Strontium. All kaolin is EPK. Remember... glazes don't travelwell. Your results will probably be TOTALLY different. Please testbefore use.

Ihave used this glaze for years now with good success but it requirescone 10 flat and 11 tipping to mature. I would like to lower thetemp. to a 9 flat and cone 10 tipping but don't really know where tobegin. I fire a 35 cubic ft. Minnesota Flat Top with natural gas. Ifanyone can get me started, I would be grateful. Also, I have beentrying to paint with stains over this glaze. I use them mixed withwater and gerstly borate but can't get a smooth flow going. I waswondering how mixing the stains right in with some of the Buttermilkwould work. Does anyone have suggestions??? Many thanks for yourtime.

I may havelowered the temperature too much - so - mix this one (500 grams) andtest it in a cool part of your kiln (with large cones beside it. Thenmix equal parts (by volume) with your original. This will give youthe recipe between the two. If it is better than either the new one Iam sending add each ingrediant together (fome my new one and your oldone) to get the recipe for the middle one. Gerstley borate 10.5 +13.0 = 23.5 divided by 2 =11.75 for instance. By the way both glazesare seriously short of Alumina and Silica and oversupplied withMagnesium so don't consider this a durable glaze. There is not atoxicity problem because there are no problematic oxides in the glaze- just be careful what you mix with and put under or over this glazein areas that will come in contact with food.

I have found that my blue celadonglaze, which is very similar to others given to you, likes all thereduction I can give it. I fire blue celadon pieces in the samefirings I go for carbon trapping with my shinos. The extra reductionalong with a good thick application of the blue celadon glaze, Ithink, encourages the bubbles trapped in the glaze which gives it anice softness to the glossy glaze. I introduce a heavy reduction atcone 010 through to cone 06 then lighten up a bit for the rest of thefiring. Also, drips melt out and do not show. Despite the onlyaverage amount of clay in the glaze, but high amount of feldspar andflint, the glaze does not run at all at cone 10 EPK helps and useSpanish Red Iron oxide and do not get any speckling. I feel the blueceladon glaze is much nicer on porcelain. You may need to add asuspender, I don't though. I have substituted Strontium Carbonate forhalf of the Barium and all of the Barium at 1 part Barium to 3/4parts Strontium and received just as nice results. I have theunderstanding from talking with other colleagues that the glazeshould be safe from Barium poisoning because it is a glossy glazewhere enough silica molecules have combined with the Barium moleculesto make it stable. But, I have never had it tested. Does anyone knowif this is true or not? Please reply.

I fully expect this version to perform like theoriginal. Both might crackle on a tight porcelain. Should be funtrying the three.

It's a lime green celedon the wayI color it. I use 5% of a native Oregon clay that is very high inIron. You could maybe get the same color with 5% or so of Albertaslip, or Albany. 1 to 2% additions of red or black iron will giveceledons. It is often said that black iron oxide gives bluerceledons, so you might want to try that. It is important to keep aglaze's content of titanium at a near zero level to develop blueceledons as well. Titanium will encourage green. I ran your Neph Syceledon through Insight and you could reduce the crazing and maybeeliminate it by the direct substitution of potash feldspar for theNeph Sy. You might want to try both Custer and G-200. Custer ishigher in silica and would be the most effective one to lower theglazes expansion.

It doesn't crackle/craze (eye of the beholderthing) and can run the gamut from non-milky matte at lower temp to anice high gloss at c.10-11. (The recipe lists it as Cone 10 Clear)(use a mortar & pestle to grind Cornwall stone before mixing) I usethis over a porcelain throwing body from Val Cushing's notebook(published and distributed during Summer Class 1993): GROLLEG 55 (1full bag) KONA 4 SPAR 20 FLINT 12 PYRAX 13 MACALOID 2 (or Bentonite:let sit with water in mixer overnight.

Very tolerant andforgiving. It is somewhat uninteresting by itself although it is as stable asyou can imagine. Add colorants for the real action!*How long have you been using this glaze? 8-10 years*Where is it used?  Bob Kavanagh's studio.*Where did this recipe come from?  I developed it over a few years.*What do you like most about this glaze?  It is stable, adaptable, accepts diversecolors well, applies easily, is virtually fault free - a good friend.*Does this glaze tend to craze/crawl/pinhole/etc.? With the majolica, it may crawl if the glaze is applied VERY thickly.*How do different firing temperatures/atmospheres affect the glaze? It may be used in reduction as well as in oxidation, although I nowuse it only in oxidation.  I developed it while I was working in areducing atmosphere.  The differences between oxidation and reductionlie in the clarity of the glaze (much clearer in oxidation) and ofcourse the impact of reduction on iron bearing oxides.*How does the glaze behave on different clay bodies? Very adaptable to stoneware, porcelain, rough, smooth, etc.*What consistency should the glaze be for pouring/dipping? Dip hand into bucket; can hardly see skin under glaze on hand: thickcream.*How thickly should the glaze be applied to the pot? Varies with oxide addition.  Likes to be moderately thick forrichest results.*How does this glaze interact with other glazes? I had not been happy with combining it with others, so I stopped. Itcan be layered with itself with different colorants in each layer.*What is your kiln type and size? 10 cubic foot, Tucker's Cone Art, electric*How do you typically fire? 0 to 212 in two hours: hold 10 minutes. 212 to 1040 at about 300 degrees an hour. very slowly from 1040 to 1070. as quickly as possible from 1070 to 2100. about 150 degrees an hour until cone 7-8.*Do you experience problems with the raw glaze? no problems*GlazeBase recipe* Submitted by: bob kavanagh (bkav@vax2.concordia.ca)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Variations --*Variations: berry rust:      10% red iron oxide deep river red:  20% RIO midnight blue:   5% cobalt carb., 2% RIO, 1% copper carb. silver yellow:   6% vanadium oxide, touch of rutile majolica:        7% tin oxideGlaze name: Clear Buttery Matt #415Cone: 10Color: translucent clearTesting: UntestedSurface: semi matteFiring: Ox. or Red.Recipe:Cornwall Stone	85.00Whiting	10.00Magnesium carbonate	5.00Comments:cone 10 clear matt.

On all our cone 10+firings, in ox or red., we have a great clear. In salt fire, however,if the vapor hits the inside of, say a bowl, or if the clear is onthe outside of the pot, then it crazes horribly. If we prevent thevapor from hitting the surface of the clear, it does well. (or if itis very thin on the outside of the pot). This glaze does very well inour wood fire kiln-no crazing at all. It will be matt if it doesn'tget a good cone 10 if that helps any.

Test your glazes and see whathappens. I have sprayed other glazes on rims etc. and all worked fine.*What is your kiln type and size? 30 cu.ft. downdraft gas kiln.*How do you typically fire? Heating...pilots (4) on over night or at least a 9 hour period.Burners (4) on low over night or till cone 07 is down. Turn up theburners to 1/2 way mid. reduce kiln for 30 to 45 mins. depending onthe weather.  Cut the reduction (open dampers to almost open and alight reduction till cone 10 falls. Clear kiln, shut off and seal. Slow 36 hour cool before cracking the door and work comes out inabout 48 hours.*Do you experience problems with the raw glaze? NO....this glaze can be stirred easily even after 8 weeks of non useand stays stirred for long periods of time while glazing. I make alarge green garbage pail of my well used glazes and they last me fora yr. or more.  No smells etc.*What is your water pH? City water.*Any other comments? Try this glaze...it will be a main stay in your studio. ;>}}}*GlazeBase recipe* Submitted by: Peggy Heer / Heer Pottery (p4337@connect.ab.ca) Ice Cream Flavor: Chocolate  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Glaze name: Cobalt Green (from CM)Cone: 10Color: rich greenTesting: Surface: Firing: Recipe:Gerstley borate	2.00Whiting	5.00Nepheline syenite	70.00Petalite	15.00Ball clay	8.00Cobalt carbonate	1.00Rutile	2.00Bentonite	2.00Comments:Nice, rich, appealing.

Likes a fast cooling to developthat electric blue. One dip gives you brown, two dips a deep blue.Tends to break on ridges. Where real heavy you get white. Flows quitea bit, especially combined with other glazes. Watch your bottomfeet,try to give it a good foot or a strong ridge to stop flow.Tapering the bottom edge with a straight edge helps too. Otherwiseyour shelf will be a beautiful shade of blue. If thick, tends topinhole, likes to dry and be rubbed out before firing. Tempermentalglaze---can crawl just enough to make you crazy generally under rimsand on the inside of rims....probably is thicker there and shrinkswhen drying. To Mix, we've found it best to dissolve the Cornwallfirst and let set a bit, then add everything else. Screen through a40 once and an 80mesh twice for finest crystalization. This is acompilation of several background messages re: the Conrad Moonlight.We use Conrads Moonlight (which was discussed about 6 months agohere) with about 1/2%cobalt Carb. added. It's a cone 10 glaze. Ifirst started using it in electric firing, and a year ago switched togas. At first in the gas, it was muddier and tended toward rutileblue-green. Then, experimenting, we cooled the kiln faster to matchthe curve of the electrics. Voila, nice sharp crystals and blue. Italso seems to be quite sensitive to temperature, over fire it and itgrabs iron from anywhere and goes blue green or brownish. I alsomight note that it is quite sensitive to application. It must go onthick to develop a good blue. (even sometimes giving almost purple).Thick in the bucket, double dip as soon as the sheen leaves, drycompletely, then rub lightly everywhere and especially on compundcurves. This is a Cornwall recipe and tends to crawl if not thorughlybonded to the clay surface. The thickness required doesn't help.Don't know what it might do at c6 but if you can get it there, theabove notes might help. One note, I mentioned that it's sensitive totemp. It's happiest between 9-1/2 and 10-1/2. Also we use it on awhite stoneware. On iron body clays, it tends toward blue green orbrown-green...not too pretty. Joyce brought up a good pointThe rutileblue Moonlight from Conrad (G375) is r understand, most rutile bluesare. The way we work around this is to provide a ridge at the footand, when Betsy applies the glaze, she takes a stainless rib andcarves a taper into the ridge. Sounds time consuming, and is, but itgoes pretty fast after you've done (not had) a few. The main time welose pieces from running now is where there's an overlap with anotherglaze, especially Temmoku. But by keeping it high on the pot, it canbe controlled. Good Luck. It can be a fantastic rutile blue, bestI've seen. I'll be off the list for a week, at Rosen, but will pulldigests during the week.

I'll continue testing and reporting as thewinter DRAGS on. All the glazes were tested on #900 Miller clay whichis a toasty ^10 stoneware. One side of the test tile was brushed witha thick coating of Cynthia Bringle's wet/dry white slip. Each glazewas dipped in three thicknesses on a heavily textured tile. All tileswere fired to a (hard)^9 (10 tipping)reduction firing. 1 hr. Bodyreduction at ^08 and 1 hr. glaze reduction at ^9 then a quick reox.before shutdown. Any time potash or Custer spar is called for, I usedG-200. All ball clay is OM-4 . Many glazes I substituted 75% of theamount of Barium with Strontium. All kaolin is EPK.

A heavy reduction at the end is recommended.  Firingtime should be between 12 and 20 hours.  Not enough reduction duringthe firing will cause the glaze to be clear.*How long have you been using this glaze? I've used this glaze off and on for 2 years.*Where is it used? University of Houston*Where did this recipe come from? This could be a Carlton Ball glaze, but I'm not sure.*Is this glaze reliable? The firing process is what's difficult about this glaze.  You shouldstart reducing around cone 5 and do a heavy reduction at the end.*Does this glaze tend to craze/crawl/pinhole/etc.? You should make sure the surface of the pot is clean of dust.*How do different firing temperatures/atmospheres affect the glaze? Too muddy of a reduction will cause the copper to burn out.  Toolittle will cause the glaze to run clear.*How does the glaze behave on different clay bodies? White or light bodies are best, but it does work on red clay bodies.*What consistency should the glaze be for pouring/dipping? Once you have mixed the glaze with water, you need to use it thatday. A thick application is best. Dipped if possible.  Once mixed theelements settle out and will not work if remixed.*How thickly should the glaze be applied to the pot? The thicker the better, but the glaze will run.*How does this glaze interact with other glazes? It works great with rutile glazes.*What is your kiln type and size? I used an updraft reduction kiln about 9 cubic feet.*How do you typically fire? I build temperature up to a cone 6 then reduce there for an hour,then go the rest of the way up reducing all the way.  With a heavyreduction at the end.  Then let it cool completely with all holesplugged and dampers shut tight.*Do you experience problems with the raw glaze? Keep materials dry until you are ready to use.  It will not staymixed and the chemicals alter if left wet for more than 48 hours.*GlazeBase recipe* Submitted by: Suzanne (SuzZim@swbell.com)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Glaze name: Copper Red (Walter Donald Kring)Cone: 9 - 10 - 11Color: copper redTesting: UntestedSurface: glossy, shinyFiring: reductionRecipe:Gerstley borate	9.10Whiting	14.30Nepheline syenite	44.30Potash feldspar	6.20Kaolin	2.60Flint	23.60Copper carbonate	0.40Tin oxide	1.00Comments:The following two glazes are the copper red recipe's I've had themost success with from rafael molina-rodriguez (rafaelmolina-rodriguez)Glaze name: Copper Red 2Cone: 10Color: redTesting: UntestedSurface: Firing: reductionRecipe:Nepheline syenite	12.50Custer feldspar	22.40Silica	32.90Colemanite	15.80Zinc oxide	9.30Barium carbonate	7.00Copper carbonate	2.20Tin oxide	1.70Comments:submitted by: June M.

I fire this glaze to cone 10 just tipping.If over-fired the red starts to burn out. The glaze is a strong RED,which under heavy reduction and where it is thick tends toward an oilspot effect. Be careful with thick pplication at the bottom of thepiece, as there is a fine point at the end of the firing where theglaze tends to run.

I have used these glazes for years, they do work,but must be fired correctly to get the red. I will not go into thecorrect firing of copper reds because it depens so much on the kilnand burner set up you have. I have found that some kilns simply donot produce good copper reds by any method I was able to fire themwhile others produced reds easly. I fire in an Olsen 36 cu. ft. updraft soft brick kiln with only moderate reduction and get goodconsistant bright copper reds t hroughout the kiln. Good luck andgood potting.

The good 'ol Chinese Stoneware Glazes book by Grebanier hasallot about copper reds and peach blooms. The one formula that is forcone 10 (most should be fired to no more that cone 9) is below. It isa deep, semi-mat red; (when fired to cone 9, it produces a peachbloom, somewhat more mat.) Where thick it develops a slight bluishopalescence. Best results are achieved with a white slip under theglaze. Also note the Godfrey or Maine feldspar: I have lookedeverywhere and know now that it is no longer available. The bestsubstitute, as I know it, is neph syenite. Also note it's a veryrunny glaze! If you decide on some Cone 9 fireings, let me know, ortry to get your hands on a copy of Grebanier.

Lighter coats, especially over buff clays yieldgreens and blues and almost a glossy surface. - Kiln size,manufacture and type: Skutt 1027 - Effects of firing to differentcones: - Coloring oxides, stains and opacifiers tested: - Known glazeflaws: - Apparent viscosity for pouring and dipping: - Applicationthickness: Depends on the desired effect. It can be dipped, butbrushing yields more interesting effects and greater color variety. -Effects on different clay bodies: See above - Interactive effect withother glazes: One of the most exciting effects develops when usingthis over a white glaze covering porcelain clay. An extremely lightcoat brushed on yields bright sea blues and greens with patches ofalmost gold. Over the same white glaze on buff clay, the cobalt bluedominates. (The white glaze I use tends to turn virtually clear overbuff or brown clay, leaving a glossy, faintly white blue finish.) -Specific gravity of glaze for pouring and dipping: - WaterGlaze name: Green Dark Aquamarine GoldbergCone: 9Color: Blue-greenTesting: Surface: Firing: ReductionGlaze type: High-fireTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Feldspar	56.00Whiting	20.00Ball clay	2.00Spodumene	7.00Bone ash	4.00Gerstley borate	5.00Calcined kaolin	6.00Chromium oxide	0.50Cobalt carbonate	0.50Nickel carbonate	0.05Comments:From Scott Goldberg.

This base recipemakes a good blue celadon with the addtion of 2% Black Iron oxide. Ifyou want it bluer you can do a variation with 1-2% black iron oxideand .25% cobalt carbonate. It is also a good rutile blue withvariations from 1-4% Rutile and !-2% Yellow ochre, or Red Iron.oxide. This base is also reactive with copper so you can get niceflashing with just a hint to copper brushwork on a pot on the celadoncolors.

Rather than wait I'm going to give you ours except wecall it green. I could send you a nice temmoku glaze that we use andguess what we call it. You guessed it , that's our black glaze. Melhad mentioned some time ago that he was not getting the iron contentright. We found that with this glaze what makes it spectacular is theseiving. We first seive thru 80 mesh and then twice thru 150 mesh. Itis dynamite on porcelain . Good with oxides or shows up details underthe surface. Also very good on stoneware.

But first letme tell you a bit about your current recipe. As you gave it, thisglaze is a high alkaline earth glaze, a bit low in alumina, butotherwise smack in the midfire range c4-c7. It's unusual in the factthat it has 5.2% Titanium oxide and this will cause problems,pinholing being one of them. The glaze is prone to pinholing becausethere's too much carbonate in the raw materials. The COE at 7.2 is abit high but it could well fit a stoneware of 6.+ COE. Ok. Here's thenew version. This version closely matches the Unity Formula of youroriginal. I have switched to Wollastonite and Talc to reduce thecarbonate level. You could also use copper oxide black 40 units, orcopper oxide red, 35 units and reduce the carbonate a bit more butthe copper oxides are very hard to disperse and you may get specklingif you do not thoroughly screen the mix. The gerstley borate ishigher than I'd wish but if I use Ferro frit 3134 (or 3195) in itsplace the alumina goes up almost 50% and the KNaO content goes uptoo, increasing the COE to 7.7 or higher; the glaze could crazemarkedly. The best course would be to try this mix first and see ifit gives you the blue-green you want without pinholes. If out-gassingis still a problem, then perhaps one could use half Gerstley B andhalf 3195. I suggest, if this sits ok with you, that you go thisroute and see what happens and only make a further revision ifneeded. Tom Buck <aa563@main.freenet.hamilton.on.ca> Sana's Green isactually a C10R recipe that I posted here a while back because I washaving pinhole problems with it.

I'll continue testing andreporting as the winter DRAGS on. All the glazes were tested on #900Miller clay which is a toasty ^10 stoneware. One side of the testtile was brushed with a thick coating of Cynthia Bringle's wet/drywhite slip. Each glaze was dipped in three thicknesses on a heavilytextured tile. All tiles were fired to a (hard)^9 (10tipping)reduction firing. 1 hr. Body reduction at ^08 and 1 hr. glazereduction at ^9 then a quick reox. before shutdown. Any time potashor Custer spar is called for, I used G-200. All ball clay is OM-4 .Many glazes I substituted 75% of the amount of Barium with Strontium.All kaolin is EPK.

I'll continue testingand reporting as the winter DRAGS on. All the glazes were tested on#900 Miller clay which is a toasty ^10 stoneware. One side of thetest tile was brushed with a thick coating of Cynthia Bringle'swet/dry white slip. Each glaze was dipped in three thicknesses on aheavily textured tile. All tiles were fired to a (hard)^9 (10tipping)reduction firing. 1 hr. Body reduction at ^08 and 1 hr. glazereduction at ^9 then a quick reox. before shutdown. Any time potashor Custer spar is called for, I used G-200. All ball clay is OM-4 .Many glazes I substituted 75% of the amount of Barium with Strontium.All kaolin is EPK. Remember... glazes don't travel well. Your resultswill probably be TOTALLY different. Please test before use. TracyWilson Saltbox Pottery 4 Shaw Rd.

Some firings are ok, thenwe'll have a terrible load even tho we fire the same schedule eachtime. We thot it might be the new water (it's softer, so we wonderedif it might have more sodium), but tried the 'old' water, got thesame blisters, altho not as bad (for a load or 2). We typically fire(propane) to ^10 tip touching, in about 11-12 hours) start reductionat ^012 at the coolest spot in the kiln. We take an hour from ^9 to^10, then usually leave the damper open for an hour to quick coolbefore we close it. We tried closing it immediately for a slow cool,hoping to smooth out the glaze, but still had blisters and had lostall our great blues. The temp is within 1/2 cone throughout the kiln,and reduction seems fairly even. The other thing is that it isn'tevery pot in that glaze. On one shelf, the pots on one side might beblistered and the other side fine, and one shelf up or down theopposite side is affected. It seems worse when the glaze is thin.Sometimes a re-fire helps smooth them out. Our 2 claybodies arePlainsman H443 (brown) and H551 (white). Could it be the clay? Wehave some blisters in other glazes too, altho not as bad. The onlycommon ingredient in custer spar. I hope I've given you enough infoto help me.

Continue moderate to lightreduction until cone 10 then a brief oxidation peroid of about 10minutes. If you over reduce it will be liver brown and under reducedwill be celadon. One solution to a problem (uneven, spotty reductionand under reduced)we had was to turn down the gas and air. To slow itdown and reduce at the above schedule. We were firing in an Alpineupdraft with blowers and just running the same schedule as the peoplewho fired before us. (It was a community center). They were firing at4 pounds pressure (natural gas) with the blowers at 70. Somethinglike that. But we reduced the gas and the air and the firing was 100%better. No more spotty reduction or unreduced pots.

As quoted this is a high alkali glaze (sodium andlithium) and unusually high alumina 1.6 moles (29.5% by weight). Thisglaze doesn't fit the pattern of C10R glazes but works if one appliesit carefully. (The iron comes from the raw materials and totals 0.01moles, 0.35%) A thin singlecoat yeilds variegated organge especiallyon a embossed surface. If a second coat is applied, one gets a greyedwhite, and if the glaze is even thicker it will crawl.

I've beenusing one for a few firings now that I like pretty well; it respondsin an interesting way to different atmospheres and clay bodies. Alittle more inFiring: Some salting is involved in all of the woodfirings I have used this slip in- generally about 1 1/2 - 3 poundsper chamber. These are not super long firings -in the 14-18 hourrange, so a lot of the surface effect comes from the salt rather thanfrom a lot of ash. I have also used it in salt/soda and it lookedgreat-more orange than brown. I haven't used it with a real heavyload of salt but if you try it I'd like yo know how it looks. Mixjust a little on the thin side and its works on bisque just as wellas on geenware I've been working up some variations using Helmerkaolin, but haven't hit one I like yet. If you get a response aboutthe Avery will you pass it along?

I put it on some test bowls madefrom Miller 510, which is a packaged cone 10 white stoneware, themakeup of which I don't know. The slip was a little thin when I mixedit , so I used a little epsom salts to thicken to what I am used towith an Avery slip going on leather hard. Fired to ^10, it flashedgorgeously, but also cracked and jumped off the pots. Any suggestionsfor a better fit? Bentonite? I guess I should find out more about theclay body before submitting this, and I will do that. In themeantime, any suggestions would be most welcome.TIA submitted by:John Anthony source for original recipe: Jeremy Nudell Kalin e-mail:JTRAX@AOL.comGlaze name: Slip Johnston FlashingCone: 10Color: OrangeTesting: UntestedSurface: unglazedFiring: ReductionGlaze type: Slip glazeTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Grolleg	50.00Newman Red	10.00EPK	10.00Nepheline syenite	30.00Comments:Clay Times May/June 2002Glaze name: slip Louis' SaltCone: 9 - 10Color: Testing: UntestedSurface: UnglazedFiring: Ox. or Red.Glaze type: SlipRecipe:AP Green Fireclay	22.52OM-4 Ball Clay	22.52Cedar Heights Goldart Clay	22.52EPK	22.52Custer feldspar	5.41Silica	4.50Comments:Also add: Grog to taste New to sprayed soda, I'll reply with what Idid. My clay body is an APGreen based stoneware with no added ironand lightened up with some EPK, It has some pyrophillite grog fromCedar Heights, and some fine silica sand. Clay body used by MakenzieSmith at TAMUCC workshop 1995. The firing was done in oxidation. Someof my students had some darker clays in the kiln and reduction givesa form of boredom brown to them. As the kiln was cone 9 ish I startedto spray in the 1 gallon of water with 5 pounds of soda ash(approximate). A nice variety of residual soda effects resulted withorange peel on some rims and dry surfaces where pots were tightlystacked. When the hot spot in the kiln showed a little warping of thepots the kiln was turned off. The firing from dull red heat tookabout 16 hours. It could have been done quicker, but there werenumerous orifice adjustments and I like to go slow in a new kiln. Ido my best to have the kiln going slower than 1 cone per hour abovecone 8. I think it produces more lively glaze surfaces. submitted by:Louis Katz e-mail: lkatz@falcon.tamucc.eduGlaze name: Slip McKenzie's Yellow for SodaCone: 9-10Color: YellowTesting: Surface: unglazedFiring: Salt - SodaGlaze type: SlipTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Nepheline syenite	31.60Ball clay	63.20Flint	5.30Zircopax Plus	5.30Titanium dioxide	7.00Comments:From McKenzie Smith, who says, "She's a honey in soda Not sure about porcelain buton stoneware it sure is nice."Glaze name: slip Mills BisqueCone: 8 - 10Color: white as baseTesting: Surface: slip or engobeFiring: Glaze type: SlipRecipe:Calcined kaolin	25.00Ball clay	25.00Potash feldspar	45.00Ferro frit 3124	5.00Comments:originally specified Calcium Borate Frit - almost any calcium boronfrit should work.

My experience with copper red is that whatmatters most is to begin reduction at cone 012 fairly heavy and thengo into moderate reduction after cone 05 drops. Continue moderate tolight reduction until cone 10 then a brief oxidation peroid of about10 minutes. If you over reduce it will be liver brown and underreduced will be celadon. One solution to a problem (uneven, spottyreduction and under reduced)we had was to turn down the gas and air.To slow it down and reduce at the above schedule. We were firing inan Alpine updraft with blowers and just running the same schedule asthe people who fired before us. (It was a community center). Theywere firing at 4 pounds pressure (natural gas) with the blowers at70. Something like that. But we reduced the gas and the air and thefiring was 100% better. No more spotty reduction or unreduced pots.(I kind of miss those unwanted interesting results though.) submittedby: John Britt e-mail: claydude@erinet.comGlaze name: Spodumene 1 V.C.Cone: 9 - 10Color: Buff to brownTesting: UntestedSurface: Smooth MattFiring: ReductionGlaze type: Ca Mg AlMattRecipe:Custer spar	30.00EPK	24.00Spodumene	20.00Dolomite	22.00Whiting	4.00Zircopax	6.00Comments:Similar to T.S.

All tiles were fired to a (hard)^9 (10tipping)reduction firing. 1 hr. Body reduction at ^08 and 1 hr. glazereduction at ^9 then a quick reox. before shutdown.

I fire to ^8 ox. on Sheffield's T3 body. When I useAmaco underglaze or a slip made from the clay body, bisqued to ^06and then put Translucent Gray-White semi-matte over it, pinholingoccurs only over the underglaze or slip. I suspect the problem lieswith the gases escaping from the slip and underglaze but I don't knowhow to deal with this. I have a Paragon kiln with a computer controlhoobee but it doesn't have a soak option (if I had only known!).submitted by: Leona Stonebridge Arthen e-mail:leona@arthen.ultranet.comGlaze name: Transparent/ClearCone: 9-10Color: ClearTesting: TestedSurface: GlossFiring: Ox. or Red.Glaze type: High-fireTransparency: TransparentCrystals: NoneFlow: NoneDurability: GoodRecipe:Potash feldspar	778.40Whiting	603.00EPK	570.50Flint (silica)	940.80Bentonite	28.90Comments: This is an excellent transparent/clear glaze that is very hard anddurable. I have used it over colored slip, with sgraffito into theslip and with oxides and stains brushed over it and the decorationsdon't move. This glaze can be brought to the VERY edge of the footwithout moving. I use it inside of all my functional work and whendecorating with colored slips I use it over the whole surface of thepot. It is an excellent glaze that will always perform well especiallywhen you are in a hurry to get things fired. No surprises. Food-safe.*Variations: Can add 1/4 % Copper Carbonate for Light Green in Oxidation ^9-10firing.*How long have you been using this glaze? Almost 20 years*Where is it used? In my studio*Where did this recipe come from? I got this recipe from Kieth Campbell from Ontario, Canada butbelieve that it is an Alfred Univ. glaze originally*What do you like most about this glaze? There are no surprises and I can count on it every time. Its foodsafe.*Is this glaze reliable? Very*Does this glaze tend to craze/crawl/pinhole/etc.? Crazes if applied TOO THICK.*How do different firing temperatures/atmospheres affect the glaze? Electric/Oxidation or Gas fired/Reduction or neutral fire are allequally as good.*How does the glaze behave on different clay bodies? On porcelain and white stoneware it is clear white. On buff and orred bodies it goes somewhat grey because of the iron in the clays.Very pleasent on all clays. I have tested and used on all the aboveclays.*What consistency should the glaze be for pouring/dipping? The consistancy of my glazes is like homo milk. The normalconsistancy. I dip to the count of 5 - 10.*How thickly should the glaze be applied to the pot? Normal. I spray this glaze as well to 1/16th of an inch or better.*How does this glaze interact with other glazes? I like it the way it is for my work.  Test your glazes and see whathappens. I have sprayed other glazes on rims etc. and all worked fine.*What is your kiln type and size? 30 cu.ft. downdraft gas kiln.*How do you typically fire? Heating...pilots (4) on over night or at least a 9 hour period.Burners (4) on low over night or till cone 07 is down. Turn up theburners to 1/2 way mid. reduce kiln for 30 to 45 mins. depending onthe weather.  Cut the reduction (open dampers to almost open and alight reduction till cone 10 falls. Clear kiln, shut off and seal. Slow 36 hour cool before cracking the door and work comes out inabout 48 hours.*Do you experience problems with the raw glaze? NO....this glaze can be stirred easily even after 8 weeks of non useand stays stirred for long periods of time while glazing. I make alarge green garbage pail of my well used glazes and they last me fora yr. or more.  No smells etc.*What is your water pH? City water.*Any other comments? Try this glaze...it will be a main stay in your studio. ;>}}}*GlazeBase recipe* Submitted by: Peggy Heer / Heer Pottery (p4337@connect.ab.ca) Ice Cream Flavor: Chocolate  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Glaze name: TurquoiseCone: 10Color: TurquoiseTesting: Surface: Satin mattFiring: Glaze type: Magnesium mattTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Custer spar	34.50Gerstley borate	4.00Dolomite	18.10Whiting	4.00EPK	23.30Silica	16.10Cobalt carbonate	1.00Chrome oxide	0.50Comments:Bulletproof.

ALberta slip: At cone 9 Alberta byitself it makes a rich chocolate brown. It's too refractory to workat cone 6 by itself, I was told, so I didn't test it.I added 30%Gerstley borate which was the wrong thing to do, as Alberta is veryglassy to begin with, but I had intended to test at cone 6 as well soI tested for both 6 and 9. I didn't really like the result at cone 6with the gerstley, as it was a frosty transparent olive green (atcone 9 it was a RUNNY transparent olive green. Adding Manganese orcobalt to the Alberta slip would probably give a really nice black.What I left out in making this one was Gerstley 10 (Rob usesColemanite), but what I ended up with was a stony black with verytiny brown specks.

It's a good glaze that I formulated in my CeramicsI class at University of Central Oklahoma way back there. It is verydependable, doesn't run, you can use a brush over it or under it(with a bit of understandable muting), colors stay in place, it'sglossy, I use it in reduction but in oxidation it loses a bit ofcharacter due to the really white look, You can use it as a base forwax resist with glazes or oxides over. It's the only glaze I've usedcontinually for the past 30 years and on many different bodies. Ilike it and like what it does. If you try it I hope that you like ittoo! Enjoy>>>>>>>>>>> PS...Take Rhodes 32, color it with 1% cobaltoxide and 4% red iron, apply it over this glaze and get a really neatsemi-mat blue.

The phosphorus contributes anumber of qualifies to the glaze. It is a glass-former (like the silica), but thephosphorus and silica don't like to mix together (sort of like oil and water).This means that in the firing, the phosphorus tends to separate out and form acloudy, slightly opalescent milkiness that I find very interesting. It also has astrong tendency to re-oxidize colorants in a glaze, which can result in unusual,vivid colors that have the richness of reduction firing, combined with theintensity of oxidation colors. A side effect of the phosphorus is that the glazenow resists going matte. It will if pushed葉hat is, if the cooling is slow enough,or if the piece is refired in a bisque kiln to allow enough time for the mattingcrystals to grow. Otherwise, it is a glossy glaze. The next step (after coming upwith the base glaze) was to try out all the common glaze colorants and see whatthey did in this glaze. The results are fascinating, and many are beautiful. I'mcurrently in the process of developing more complex colors involving multipleoxides, and I'll pass those along in a future column.If you've ever mixed a tomato red glaze, you'll notice that it always includes asource of magnesium (such as talc or dolomite) and either natural or syntheticbone ash (a source of phosphorus). Together with iron and the other components,these create iron crystals, and push them into an oxidized state. As I suspectedit would, Pete's CIA produces a bright tomato red with 7 or 8% red iron oxide. Asthe amount of iron increases to 10 or 11%, the glaze becomes quite crystalline,but just a bit more brown. The red can be made brighter by refiring it (after theglaze firing) in a bisque firing, or in any low-fire oxidation firing.2 Manganesedioxide makes a beautiful yellow (really!) in small percentages, becoming a creamyred-amber at higher percentages. Copper carbonate, which normally wants to turn apink or red color in reduction, instead produces light blue-green to emeraldgreen. It works from 1 to 9%. Titanium dioxide or ruffle produce very nicebreaking and mottling, working best at 4 and 5%. The effect shows up best onstoneware, but also works well on porcelain with the addition of a small amount ofanother oxide (iron or copper, for instance) in addition to the titania. Tin oxideproduces white at smaller percent-ages, which begins to break rust on edges (evenon porcelain) as it nears 10%, with very pronounced cream and orange colors pro-duced on stoneware at 10% and 12%. Like the iron colors I mentioned above, it willbecome more orange when refired in a bisque or other low-fire oxidation firing.Frankly, I thought the results from cobalt and chrome were very boring, but thatmight be my taste in colors. Cobalt produced pasty, pastel blues. Chrome was nicein very tiny amounts.3% made a nice, very light blue-green, but larger amountsproduced dull greenish browns. Please keep in mind that this is a new glaze, and Idon't have extensive experience with it. I've used it (in several colorvariations) in a half dozen or so firings, and it is very promising, but I haveyet to work out all the bugs of application and firing.Glaze name: White PVCone: 8 - 10Color: WhiteTesting: Surface: shiny glossyFiring: Transparency: OpaqueRecipe:Plastic vitrox	50.00Colemanite	50.00Zircopax	15.00Comments:a friend of mine used only this glaze in a lamp factory for years andfired to cone 10. bob chance <chance_bob/furman@furman.edu>Glaze name: White Satin Matt OriellyCone: 9 - 10Color: WhiteTesting: Surface: SatinFiring: Ox. or Red.Glaze type: Magnesium mattTransparency: OpaqueSource: Val Cushing  VC ed.  via GlazeBaseRecipe:Custer feldspar	56.00Barium carbonate	2.00Dolomite	8.00Whiting	10.00EPK	6.00Zinc oxide	4.00Petalite	3.00Flint	11.00Zircopax	6.00Comments:This glaze comes from Kansas City.
