In solution, if spilled, it stainsthe surface a revolting liver colour forever. If splashed on hands orskin...liver again for many weeks. Rehearsal for age spots. Crystalsare the way to go. Silver nitrate crystals are weighed by grams andadded to distilled water. The ratio is one gram to 10 mls of water.So 5 grams go into 50 mls. etc. Store the dissolved solution in acoloured bottle and keep it out of light. When measuring the solutionto be added to your glaze WEAR RUBBER GLOVES,CLOTHING YOU HATE andopen the windows wide. This stuff doesn't smell at all but it'spowerful . Add the needed amount to the MIXED and SIEVED glaze andstir carefully. It will make the texture of the glaze peculiar atfirst, sort of curdled but keep on stirring and it will smooth out.Wash the stirring implement thoroughly especially if it's metal.

At first it was almostblack but inside of 15 mins it is the deepest prettiest purple I haveever seen and I have no idea who gave the receipe to me. They sure dodeserve credit. I sprayed this on JM5, a buff colored ^5 stoneware Ihad bisqued to ^08. I fired it in a small old electric I sometimesuse for raku to 1830. After pulling it we went right to a pile ofsand with 8' x8' piece of slick newspaper on the botton and as wecovered it we threw in another the same size on top of the pot,covered it with the can sealing the edges, waited about an houruntill it was cool enough to touch and got the purple surprise.

Insolution, if spilled, it stains the surface a revolting liver colourforever. If splashed on hands or skin...liver again for many weeks.Rehearsal for age spots. Crystals are the way to go. Silver nitratecrystals are weighed by grams and added to distilled water. The ratiois one gram to 10 mls of water. So 5 grams go into 50 mls. etc. Storethe dissolved solution in a coloured bottle and keep it out of light.When measuring the solution to be added to your glaze WEAR RUBBERGLOVES,CLOTHING YOU HATE and open the windows wide. This stuffdoesn't smell at all but it's powerful . Add the needed amount to theMIXED and SIEVED glaze and stir carefully. It will make the textureof the glaze peculiar at first, sort of curdled but keep on stirringand it will smooth out. Wash the stirring implement thoroughlyespecially if it's metal. This glaze is best painted on in threesmooth coats. Use a special brush for this glaze as it will be perm.stained black.
