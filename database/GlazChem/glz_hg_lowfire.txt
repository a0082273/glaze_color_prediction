She askedif we could develop an amber/clear.  Suddenly I had a brainstorm!  Replace theflint and kaolin in the troublesome recipe above with Redart.  The glaze softwaresaid it was nearly a chemical match for the original glaze.  Tests look verypromising.  It didn't blister, it looked beautiful, and it doesn't turn to stonein the bucket.

It is somewhat shiny.  I like it that wayand I don't care what anyone else thinks!Chrome does well at less than 1%.  Cobalt 1%.  Black iron oxide works better thanred iron.  Copper looks beautiful but causes the glaze to bubble and shiver.Rutile can be unpredictable.  I use titanium dioxide instead.  Mason stains givegreat colors.  Add 5% 6-tile if you want to use encapsulated cadmium stains.I mix them to close to 46 on the hydrometer.  The metal oxides effect thethickness and each variation is adjusted within a range of 45-48. I always layermy glazes.  I like the way they break when layered.  I dip for at least 3 fullseconds for each coat.  Thin pots need longer.  The glaze goes on thick.  I'vefound that fritted glazes tend to thin as they fire.  Three layers of glaze isgenerally a bad idea.  The rule in my studio is, å¦¬f you insist on using 3 layers,the third layer must be applied only on the top 1/3 of the pot."See this glaze in action at: http://www.claylink.com/Dinner2004/cummings.html Orhttp://www.claylink.com/Earthenware2005/Cummings2.htmlSee what my studio members have done with it at:http://www.claylink.com/cccs2006.html (Actually all of our glazes and clays arerepresented in this show.)I use a black glaze under this glaze on most of my pots.

It is deep blue and has a lot oflight mottling (nearly white in nature). Applied thin it is a kind ofa light buff, but applied very thick it becomes deep blue with a lotof very light mottling. If applied thick it will crack, just put theraw glaze in place by rubbing with your fingers and it will worknicely.*How long have you been using this glaze? 2 years*Where is it used? Studio*Where did this recipe come from? Of our own experimentation. I made the design and my friend BernardBrunette made all the lab work and the firing.*What do you like most about this glaze? The beautiful light mottling.*Is this glaze reliable? Yes*Does this glaze tend to craze/crawl/pinhole/etc.? It cracks at the moment of application but there are no surfaceflaws once it is fired.*How do different firing temperatures/atmospheres affect the glaze? Not tested*How does the glaze behave on different clay bodies? Well*What consistency should the glaze be for pouring/dipping? Thick*How thickly should the glaze be applied to the pot? Thick*How does this glaze interact with other glazes? Not tested*What is your kiln type and size? 22x27 electric kiln*How do you typically fire? Typical oxidation until cone 04, ended by a short period of soakingof 30 minutes*Do you experience problems with the raw glaze? No*What is your water pH? 7.2*GlazeBase recipe* Submitted by: Edouard Bastarache (edouardb@sorel-tracy.qc.ca) Ice Cream Flavor: Maple polkadot vanilla  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Return to GlazeBase PageGlaze name: Blue Andy's WaterCone: 06-04Color: BlueTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: AlkalineTransparency: TransparentRecipe:Gerstley borate	5.80EPK	7.20Frit 3110	76.90Flint	10.10Comments:Variations --try 4% copper, or 0.5% chrome or 1% chrome or 0.5 cobaltor 3% manganeseGlaze name: Blue Black PurpleCone: 08 - 06Color: silver blue to silver bronzeTesting: UntestedSurface: Firing: Ox. or Red.Glaze type: Ca B MidRoadRecipe:Gerstley borate	50.00Nepheline syenite	50.00Copper carbonate	50.00Rutile	50.00Comments:NOTE that recipe is in parts - not stated whether that's parts byweight or volume This is to LJ in Alexandria and anyone elseinterested in raku glazes.

Our raku kiln is fired between 1830 and 1900 degrees.Reduce in very heavy pine needles, broken pine cones and somesawdust. The surface effect is like a 100 grit sandpaper.

It has a finegrain.  If you are used to throwing fireclay-based bodies, you will think yourhands have gone numb.  It feels sort of like the most incredibly forgivingporcelain you have ever thrown.  It can be re-wetted from nearly bone dry back toa plastic state.  My students get away with things that most clay bodies wouldnever allow.This body is 90% clay.  Redart is the primary flux.  Shrinkage is 12% (5% to Dry% in glost firing.) Porosity is very low. Less than 1%.Bisque to cone 08.  A higher bisque will tighten the body too much.Glaze fire to cone 1 to 3.  The cone temperatures are very close in this portionof the firing range.  I fire to cone 1 slowly to allow the glaze and clay moretime to mature.  Fast firings and small kilns may require firing as high as cone 3to achieve the same results.  I fire a 20 cubic L&L stuffed full of work with thecomputer controller set to slow glaze and a 10 minute hold at temperature.  Firingis the key.  Electric kilns require skill to get the best results too!Iè‡´e used this clay to throw very large work with very good results.  Tiny thingswork too!Downsides: It can be a little sticky.  If you cut things off the bat and leavethem in position till they get to leather hard, they may re-adhere.When fired this clay is very dense.  It rings like porcelain.  When covered by mycolor base glaze, it can be played like crystal.  It is hard, but not brittle.  Ilike to scare my students..I mean show my students how strong the clay is bybeating one of my plates on the corner of a wooden table.  I wouldn't dare do thatwith anything I have made in stoneware.Glaze name: Clay Red Charlie's Handbuilding 1-3Cone: 1-3Color: RedTesting: Surface: Firing: OxidationGlaze type: Clay (Earthenware)Recipe:Redart	35.00Foundry Hill Creme	15.00Hawthorne Bond	5.00Nepheline syenite	5.00Talc	5.00Grog	40.00Comments:From Charlie Cummings [Clay@claylink.com] This is a hand-building clay.

It is glossy, but tight, soit is excellent for overglaze brushwork with straight oxides ormaiolica colors. If it goes on too thick it will go opaque yellow -not altogether unpleasant, especially with overglaze brushwork. Note:all of these glazes contain large amounts of gerstley borate, whichis soluble with time. If you don't use the glaze up within six monthsor so you may have to toss it and mix a new batch. An alternative isto replace all of the gerstley borate with 3134 frit. source fororiginal recipe: Conrad's THE COMPLETE COMPENDIUM submitted by:Wenzel K Pitelka e-mail: WKP0067@tntech.eduGlaze name: Clear Annabeth RosenCone: 08Color: ClearTesting: Surface: Firing: OxidationGlaze type: Low fire (Boron)Transparency: TransparentRecipe:Gerstley borate	73.00EPK	25.00Lithium carbonate	2.00Comments:From Ayumi HorieVariations --sky blue 1/16% cobalt + .5% copper carbplum brown 2% manganese dioxhoney 6% RIOGlaze name: Clear Base 1 OrrCone: 03Color: ClearTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: AlkalineTransparency: TransparentRecipe:Gerstley borate	9.00Soda ash	16.00Frit 3110	66.00EPK	5.00Flint	4.00Comments:From Lisa Orr in CM.Variations --Honey yellow = Spanish Red Iron Ox 11%Turquoise = copper carb 6%Soft blue = cobalt carb .5%purple = manganese silicate 5% (for this colorant delete flint in base)Green = chroome ox .25%, copper carb 6%, RIO 11%Glaze name: Clear Base 2 OrrCone: 03Color: ClearTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: AlkalineTransparency: TransparentRecipe:Gerstley borate	12.00Frit 3110	73.00EPK	15.00Comments:From Lisa Orr in CMVariations --Honey yellow = Spanish Red Iron Ox 11%Turquoise = copper carb 6%Soft blue = cobalt carb .5%purple = manganese silicate 5% (for this colorant delete flint in base)Green = chroome ox .25%, copper carb 6%, RIO 11%Glaze name: Clear Best Variation #22Cone: 04-03Color: ClearTesting: UntestedSurface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: Low fire (Boron)Transparency: TransparentRecipe:Frit 3289	24.00Gerstley borate	33.00Spodumene	19.00Kaolin	12.00Silica	12.00Comments:From Pete Pinnell article in Clay Times May/June, 2002,  v.8 no. 3 p38Pete recommends using one color over another for added richness, and using colorsover white slip on terracottaVariations --Turquoise + copper carb 2%Gray + RIO 2, copper carb 0.3, rutile 3Blue RIO 3, copper carb 0.5Cream + rutile 4%Amber + RIO 3, Manganese Diox 1Green + RIO 2, copper carb 2, rutile 2Glaze name: Clear Best Variation #22 no GBCone: 04-03Color: ClearTesting: UntestedSurface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: Low fire (Boron)Transparency: TransparentRecipe:Frit 3185	35.70Wollastonite	19.50Barium carbonate	14.20Spodumene	18.60Potash feldspar - theoretical	4.50Kaolin - theoretical	4.00Alumina	3.50Comments:Recalculation of glaze w/o Gerstley  BorateFrom Pete Pinnell article in Clay Times May/June, 2002,  v.8 no. 3 p38Pete recommends using one color over another for added richness, and using colorsover white slip on terracottaVariations --Turquoise + copper carb 2%Gray + RIO 2, copper carb 0.3, rutile 3Blue RIO 3, copper carb 0.5Cream + rutile 4%Amber + RIO 3, Manganese Diox 1Green + RIO 2, copper carb 2, rutile 2Glaze name: Clear Best Variation #22 no GB no BaCone: 04-03Color: WhiteTesting: TestedSurface: MattFiring: OxidationGlaze type: Low fire (Boron)Transparency: TranslucentRecipe:Frit 3185	35.70Wollastonite	19.50Strontium carbonate	10.60Spodumene	18.60Potash feldspar - theoretical	4.50Kaolin - theoretical	4.00Alumina	3.50Comments:Recalculation of glaze w/o Gerstley  BorateFrom Pete Pinnell article in Clay Times May/June, 2002,  v.8 no. 3 p38Pete recommends using one color over another for added richness, and using colorsover white slip on terracottaVariations --Turquoise + copper carb 2%Gray + RIO 2, copper carb 0.3, rutile 3Blue RIO 3, copper carb 0.5Cream + rutile 4%Amber + RIO 3, Manganese Diox 1Green + RIO 2, copper carb 2, rutile 2Glaze name: Clear Charlie Cummings 1Cone: 1Color: ClearTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationTransparency: TransparentRecipe:Frit 3124	80.00Tile 6 clay	10.00Flint	10.00Comments:Charlie Cummings [Clay@claylink.com] This glaze is perfectly clear if appliedextremely thin.

A mattglaze becomes that way because micro-crystals grow out of the glass.It takes time for that to happen, and the typical electric kilnsimply cools too quickly. Both of these came out of student triaxialblends at the Kansas City Art Institute. submitted by: Pete Pinnelle-mail: ppinnell@unlinfo.unl.edu source for original recipe: KansasCity Art InstituteGlaze name: Darby's Base no GBCone: 04Color: BlackTesting: TestedSurface: GlossFiring: Ox. or Red.Transparency: OpaqueCrystals: NoneBubbles: NoneFlow: SlightDurability: GoodRecipe:Spodumene	42.00Silica	19.00Frit 3134	39.00Bentonite	2.00Comments:RE-calc of Pete Pinnell's Darby's Base w/o GB.

Put it over a clothtexture, and you have invented ceramic denim.  It reacts to the slip color underit.  It also breaks light brown over lines, brush strokes, or throwing rings.This glaze uses dolomite.  All of the books say it isn't active at this range, butmy students didn't know that.  I would have told them it wouldn't work, but I liketo let them make their own mistakes...or show me I'm so so wrong.  Now I just needto convince them to try other colorants.  This glaze likes a big kiln and a slowfiring.  The results from the small kiln were cool too, but incredibly different.Glaze name: Don's Blue 08-06Cone: 08 - 06Color: Bright blueTesting: UntestedSurface: mottledFiring: OxidationRecipe:G-200 feldspar	138.90Gerstley borate	277.80Ball clay	55.50Barium carbonate	27.80Rutile	5.60Copper carbonate	11.10Comments:From a University of Georgia class handout on glaze & clay from AndyNasisse.Glaze name: Dry Alligator Red Rust June'sCone: 06Color: RedTesting: Surface: LichenFiring: Ox. or Red.Glaze type: TextureTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Gerstley borate57.10Nepheline syenite14.30Bone ash	28.60Copper carbonate	14.30Comments:From June Raymond.

If you don't use the glaze up within sixmonths or so you may have to toss it and mix a new batch. Analternative is to replace all of the gerstley borate with 3134 frit.submitted by: Wenzel K Pitelka e-mail: WKP0067@tntech.eduGlaze name: Johnson Semi MattCone: 04Color: Testing: UntestedSurface: Firing: OxidationGlaze type: Ca Na Mg BRecipe:Frit 3124	77.28Clay	13.64Talc	9.09Comments: Glaze Type: Ca Na Mg B.

Usethese Duncan EZ-stroke transparent underglazes as overglaze wash forcolor: 003, EZ004, EZ007, EZ012, EZ014, EZ019, EZ020, EZ021, EZ024,EZ025, EZ027, EZ028, EZ030, EZ032, EZ053 (lip red), EZ161. Mostothers will work.EZ017 is slightly dry, EZ006 is quite dry - notrecommended. Cover coat CC 154 works as well. Most other Cover Coatcolors will work when quite thin, but will be dry if thick. Tryadding a teaspoonful of frit or gerstley borate to a jar of CCunderglaze for glossier color. Other color possibilities includewashes of the common colorants (mix chrome and rutile 50/50 withgerstley borate or frit).Glaze name: Majolica SiebertCone: 04Color: WhiteTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: MajolicaTransparency: OpaqueVisual texture: NoneCrystals: NoneBubbles: NoneFlow: NoneDurability: GoodSource: Terry SiebertRecipe:Frit 3124	72.00Flint	10.00EPK	12.00Zircopax	10.00Bentonite	2.00Comments:For decorating mix 25% stain or oxide with 75% frit 3124 (adjust forrefractoryness of oxide or stain) and a tablespoon of liquid laundrystarch.

Right now I am firing to cone 02 anddoing two types of decoration: one with metallic slips for a burntearth look and one with glazes. My interest here is only the glazedware. In the cases where I brush on the glaze, there is absolutely nopin holing, whether I apply the glaze very thickly, thickly orthinly. It's not so much the pin holing itself which interests me ( Iwill work to eliminate that) but rather that it does not occur when Ibrush on the glaze (whether I apply it thickly or thinly and even onseveral occasions I have brushed in on raw, fired it and had nopinholes).

Rosie'sturns a satin grey, while Darby's is a satin black. Here are a coupleof simple glazes you might try. Both are semi-gloss until you addstains, then they become more of a satin matt. The trick to getting agood matt glaze at cone 04 is to soak the kiln at the end of thefiring, and then cool a bit slower than usual (fire down). A mattglaze becomes that way because micro-crystals grow out of the glass.It takes time for that to happen, and the typical electric kilnsimply cools too quickly.

(On a buffstoneware fired C10R, it gives a grey-tone white).To this slip, toget black, he would add 5% (+/-) of his black stain which has thefollowing ingredients: 20% chromium oxide 20% cobalt (oxide orcarbonate) 20% manganese (di)oxide 20% iron oxide red 8% feldspar(any) 8% kaolin (any) 4 flint He states this mixture is best afterbeing ball-milled for a minimum of four hours to eliminate specking.He says 5% is enough for a clear glaze, more may be needed for anopaque glaze (or slip as above). If this approach isn't suitable toyour friend, perhaps it will provide a simple guide towards a blackslip. Salut!

Right now I am firing to cone 02 anddoing two types of decoration: one with metallic slips for a burntearth look and one with glazes. My interest here is only the glazedware. I have dipped using tongs and large buckets (my normalhabit);poured, using a jug simply to pour the glazes over the pots(also a normal habit); and applied the glaze on the wheel using asyringe and broad flat brush. I bisque all ware to 04 in very slow,well ventilated bisque fires. In both the dipping and pouring I amgetting a fair amount of pin holing, especially where the glaze isthick and almost not at all where the glaze is thin. In the caseswhere I brush on the glaze, there is absolutely no pin holing,whether I apply the glaze very thickly, thickly or thinly. It's notso much the pin holing itself which interests me ( I will work toeliminate that) but rather that it does not occur when I brush on theglaze (whether I apply it thickly or thinly and even on severaloccasions I have brushed in on raw, fired it and had no pinholes).Any ideas why? bob kavanagh (60 km west of montreal)bkav@vax2.concordia.ca>Glaze name: TizzyCone: 08 - 10Color: Testing: UntestedSurface: shinyFiring: OxidationGlaze type: Ca  Pb Na B RawLeadRecipe:Flint	1139.00White lead	3690.00Custer feldspar	736.00China clay	1033.00Frit 3134	1402.00Comments:Add from 4% to 9%  Tin Oxide to go from transparent to opaque.
