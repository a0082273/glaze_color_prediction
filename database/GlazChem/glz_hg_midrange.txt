The barium/boron eutectic makes it hard tosay what cone this fires to - the longer it is in kiln or the greaterthe thermal mass of the kiln the more it will flux. Formulatedoriginally without the ash or slip clay it was semi-satin, semi-gloss somewhere around cone 2. Boron subdues the copper coloration.I'm not taking responsibility for anyone using these glazes, etc.Something is probably toxic. They are examples of my research andthey work out in formulation. Which is what they are examples of. Sogo formulate your own non-toxic glazes, if that is possible. It'sprobably bad for the environment too. Email me with questions as tohousehold performance, as that may be indicative of other problems.The badly crazed surfaces are not considered to be a continous-nonporous sanitary surfaces.

Original recipe (Cone 9-10): Mixed hardwood ash 35 Oxford spar 35 China clay 15 Talc 15 I fire in anelectric kiln. I would never describe it as a foolproof glaze, but ifapplied with care, it's so beautiful that it just knocks out all thereliable competition. I bisque at ^06 and am now firing at ^6. I havegone to ^9, but that seems to present more problems with pinholingand crazing. Also, I wash the ash. I have also used the same recipewith unwashed ash. The difference is that I would describe theunwashed ash glaze as stony matt and the washed ash glaze as opaquesatin matt. Haven't tried this recipe at a lower temperature.

Doesn't add to 100 because of thestrontium/barium substitution, the bentonite, and the ash. This maybe closer to cone 5 than cone 6 but seems to work over a range of acouple cones. This is Zakin's GK base with 15% unwashed, mixedfireplace ashes, with strontium substituted for barium and superpaxfor opax. By itself over porcelain, the glaze is not particularlyinteresting. But other glazes on top of it run and drip and blendtogether nicely. I've found that if I glaze the lower 2/3 or 3/4 of apot with a well-behaved glossy glaze, brush a coat of this ZGK ashglaze on the top 1/3 or so and then brush or dip some third glaze ontop of the ash glaze, I get a nice pattern of runs that don't go offthe bottom of the pot onto the kiln shelf (usually). Different glazesgive different kinds of runs and bands of different glazes areinteresting too. The few times I tried a matte glaze on the bottom,the pots cracked. Could have been coincidence.

My glazes that get the effect are all at ^6, and usually containBoron- whether from Gerstley Borate, a frit, or Colemanite. I use adark Rutile, and some zinc- which is a little contradictory, becauseof the effect of zinc on Iron colorant. Rutile has a secondary effectwhen blue is from Cobalt-- the color effect from Cobalt is somewhattransparent, and the opacifier effect of rutile gives the Cobalt bluesomething to show up against A nice 'hint' of blue can be the effectof a small amount of Cobalt in a transparent glaze with a fair amountof Rutile. and Iron wash under it can also cause interestingvariations. This gives a good white with 5% rutile, with opalescenttones and, with luck and a good clay to work on, some blues. Tryadding a small amount of Cobalt. This glaze seems to have a lot ofingredients, but I had to change spars, and readjust the recipe usinga line blend to zero in on what I wanted. Note that there is noclay-- you may need to use a suspender, or add a little Bentonite.The Strontium I substituted for Barium is a little coarse and cansettle.

In fact, it is contributing to some unwanted seconds. The glazeis a great white, but the application is crutial and I am wonderingabout the glaze poise, or the set of the glaze on the ware. I thinkthe glaze is adequately flocculated with a solution of bentonite andFlocs, and runs at an SG of about 1.6. We have experimented withvarious dipping strategies, to no avail.There are still streak marks,thick and thin marks, from dipping. The pots are mugs, all the same,and all glazed the same. Usign tongs with sharpened points, the mugsare dipped in an arc motion to glaze both the inside and the outsideand as they are raised from the glaze bucket, on an angle, theinterior glaze slowly decants out. There are still streaks and unevenparts on the ourside surface, but only on the side that the glazeruns off. The opposite side is perfect. submitted by: Jonathan Kaplane-mail: jonathan@csn.netGlaze name: Base Kaplan's Revised 3-5Cone: 3 - 5Color: whiteTesting: UntestedSurface: Firing: oxidationRecipe:Custer feldspar	36.00Whiting	16.00Strontium carbonate	17.00Kaolin	10.00Silica	21.00Zircopax	10.00Comments:(The following is in response to a glazeing problem that J. Kaplanwas haveing with the original base.) It sounds like the problem isone of glaze formulation rather than of application. I would guessthat the glaze has too high a surface tension because of the(relatively) high amount of zinc. Looking at it chemically it lookslike a higher fire glaze that has been brought down in temperature bythe addition of zinc, so the zinc can't just be left out. I guess theeasiest solution is to substitute an oxide with a lower surfacetension for the zinc. That would point to lead, barium and strontium.I assume that lead and barium are out of the question, so I did aquick substitution using strontium carbonate.

The high magnesium content of the glazes is whatencourages the crawling action. The first one crawls into roundedbumps. Someone on the list sent it to me. The only problem that Ihave with this glaze (and I use the word glaze loosely in this case)is that after you dip your pieces into the glaze it tends to flakeoff before and sometimes during the firing. I usually brush AmacoVelvet Underglazes on the pots first and then dip them in glaze. Theglaze application should be thick to encourage the crawling... happytesting, John Post jp6mchp@moa.net Sterling Heights, MichiganGlaze name: Beth's Shiny GreenCone: 5 - 7Color: light greenTesting: Surface: Firing: Recipe:Nepheline syenite	46.74Silica	25.00Gerstley borate	10.87Ball clay	6.52Dolomite	10.87Titanium dioxide	7.61Bentonite	1.09Copper carbonate	1.63Comments:Hope this works for you.

My glazes that get the effect are all at ^6, and usually containBoron- whether from Gerstley Borate, a frit, or Colemanite. I use adark Rutile, and some zinc- which is a little contradictory, becauseof the effect of zinc on Iron colorant. Rutile has a secondary effectwhen blue is from Cobalt-- the color effect from Cobalt is somewhattransparent, and the opacifier effect of rutile gives the Cobalt bluesomething to show up against A nice 'hint' of blue can be the effectof a small amount of Cobalt in a transparent glaze with a fair amountof Rutile. and Iron wash under it can also cause interestingvariations. This gives a good white with 5% rutile, with opalescenttones and, with luck and a good clay to work on, some blues. Tryadding a small amount of Cobalt. This glaze seems to have a lot ofingredients, but I had to change spars, and readjust the recipe usinga line blend to zero in on what I wanted. Note that there is noclay-- you may need to use a suspender, or add a little Bentonite.The Strontium I substituted for Barium is a little coarse and cansettle.

They are quite versatile. These recipesare from Zakin's book on Electric Kiln Ceramics. Some of the claysused in the recipe are coarse and the slip should not be strined. Theresult will be a coarse, sandy-textured surface, not for functionalpieces. They may be applied by dipping, spraying or brushing. Theymay be applied to greenware or bisqued ware. They may be used aloneor with stains and glazes. The appearance when fired is soft andsandy.

Two years ago I took a part-time job teachingceramics at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. The college has onlyone kiln. It' an ancient Paragon High Fire. The design is square andtoploading with very small cu. ft. It's been a real challenge todevelop an attractive palette of clays and glazes for oxidationfiring.

Note you need to split thekaolin with calcined kaolin. If you don't the glaze will shrink toomuch and crack during drying, then crawl during firing. You can makeyour own calcined kaolin by bisque firing a planter full of rawkaolin. Remember to use 12% less calcined because of the LOI. I alsotried high alumina low silica and sure enough, that gives a mattetoo, just like the textbooks say.

The fuelsavings (?) were not worth the effort. The results don't compare to^10. I agree with Peter Pinnell- sell another mug to pay for thedifference in firing costs. add- 10% iron for temmoku or- 2% tinoxide & 1% copper carb. for red Due to the lower sintering point of^6 glazes- you have to start reduction fairly early- at least bystoneware standards. Try ^010 as a starting point & go from there.

I noticed that the Floating Blue haspopped up again. It is a glaze I'm familiar with since I've beenusing it for about 3 years. What caught my eye, was the descriptionof it as slate blue, which doesn't fit my results. So, I picked upthe original recipe, and it differs from the one Sharon posted. Ifyou're interested, you might try this version in your tests. It iscalled Floating Blue...from James Chappell's book, Clay and Glazes.This glaze produces a deep blue-brown background of great depth withlighter mottled blues that seem to float on the surface of thebackground glaze. The glaze has more of the lighter mottled blueswhere the application is thickest. Watch thickness near the bottom ofthe pot. The C.M.C. measurement refers to a premixed CMC and watersolution. For the Silica, I use 325 mesh Flint. The rutile, is justpowdered rutile from the ceramics supply. It fires best on the lightside of cone 6 (standard cone just bending), seems to get greener andmore fluid the higher you go. Cone 5 works well, too. I do not find aneed for bentonite. The book says to weigh the ingredients verycarefully, use distilled water or water that is known to have a lowmineral content. Mix then add the CMC solution. Sieve two or threetimes through a 60 to 80 mesh sieve to thoroughly disperse thecobalt, iron, and rutile. The book warns that the glaze is fickle,and recommends against firing this glaze in the same kiln with glazesthat contain copper, chrome, nickel or manganese. Mineral content ofthe water is an important factor. I have noticed an adverse effect asthe author noted, and now fire an entire kiln load of this glaze. Theglaze should be stirred occasionally during application because theiron has a tendency to settle. Chappell's Suggested variations:Stipple on additional glaze with brush or apply with sponge for aneven more mottled effect. Or: lightly sponge a thin wash of 3 gramsof chrome oxide to 100 grams of water plus a tablespoon of CMC overthe top to produce a floating blue glaze with subtle green tints. Or:Over the glaze, sponge lightly with a rutile wash consisting of 2grams rutile per 100g of water for a floating blue glaze withslightly tan crystalline tints on the surface. submitted by: CandiceRoeder e-mail: CRoeder1@aol.com source for original recipe: JamesChappellGlaze name: Frit 25Cone: 5 - 7Color: clearTesting: Surface: glossFiring: Recipe:Potash feldspar	34.90Pemco frit P-25	25.30Silica	25.30Whiting	5.80Gerstley borate	5.10Kentucky Ball Clay	3.60Comments:transparency: transparent used frit 3269.

Lighter coats, especially over buff clays yieldgreens and blues and almost a glossy surface. - Kiln size,manufacture and type: Skutt 1027 - Effects of firing to differentcones: - Coloring oxides, stains and opacifiers tested: - Known glazeflaws: - Apparent viscosity for pouring and dipping: - Applicationthickness: Depends on the desired effect. It can be dipped, butbrushing yields more interesting effects and greater color variety. -Effects on different clay bodies: See above - Interactive effect withother glazes: One of the most exciting effects develops when usingthis over a white glaze covering porcelain clay. An extremely lightcoat brushed on yields bright sea blues and greens with patches ofalmost gold. Over the same white glaze on buff clay, the cobalt bluedominates.

I'm not takingresponsibility for anyone using these glazes, etc. Something isprobably toxic. They are examples of my research and they work out informulation. Which is what they are examples of. So go formulate yourown non-toxic glazes, if that is possible. It's probably bad for theenvironment too. Email me with questions as to household performance,as that may be indicative of other problems. The badly crazedsurfaces are not considered to be a continous-non porous sanitarysurfaces.

Also a good base glaze - the copper can bereplaced with judicious amounts of other colourants, and they allmake pleasant matt glazes.) Here are a couple of standards from theRichmond Potters Club, and a few of my own formulation that haveworked well in ^6 oxidation. They aren't revolutionary (my excitingones have things like barium in them, or are less predictable for aclassroom situation) but they have been reliable, and allow for someplay. They all calculate out to well within the INSIGHT limitformulas for maturity at ^6. If anyone tests these and comes up withproblems, new ideas, good variations etc. could they let me know?I'll look forward to a larger list being posted to clayart.

It works very well as is at C 5-6 and is a deepforest green, slightly translucent. Occasionally I have underfired itto C4, where it becomes matte and slightly metallic and looks verynice. I hope this helps.

Ferro Frit 3134 can be substituted for Pemco Frit P-54.Good as a majolica-like opaque white glaze with oxides and stainsbrushed over it. Very stable - does not run, applies well with abrush or by other methods. Doesn't craze on cone 10 porcelain firedto cone 6 - test on cone 6 body. Tested on Aardvark stoneware clays:(listed best to worst for smooth surface) Porcelain, Hopkins White60, Joe Soldate 60, Rio Red (the last two may have a fairly grittysurface, even at cone 6). Possible Glaze Flaws:  This glaze is fairlypowdery without any binder. It will crawl slightly if applied toothickly followed by a wash of color on the raw glaze. YOU MUST addCMC to glaze batch to harden the raw surface of this glaze. Use aboutone tablespoon of CMC powder (soaked in a pint of hot waterovernight) per 3000 gram batch. Colors: Use mason stains mixed 50/50with Pemco frit P-25 or Ferro Frit 3124, or use 70 stain/30 gerstleyborate in a watery mix for colors over glaze or some combination ofgerstley borate and frit. Using too much gerstley borate may make thestain change color or become pastel. Purple stains may need to havemore flux added up to 3 parts flux to 1 part stain. If you use allfrit, add liquid starch or CMC to colors for easier brushing and tominimize smearing before they're fired. A small amount of bentonitemay also help to keep the all-frit mixture from settling out.  Thesebinders are not as necessary with the gerstley borate. Use theseDuncan EZ-stroke transparent underglazes as overglaze wash for color:EZ003, EZ004, EZ007, EZ012, EZ014, EZ019, EZ020, EZ021, EZ024, EZ025,EZ027, EZ028, EZ030, EZ032, EZ161. Almost all the other EZstrokeswill work, especially if thinned slightly. The dark blue and theorange EZstrokes will wrinkle and get rough if applied too thickly.Cover coat CC 154 should work as well. Most other Cover Coat colorswill work when  thinly applied, but may be dry if thick. Try adding ateaspoonful of frit or gerstley borate to a jar of CC underglaze forglossier color. Other color possibilities include washes of thecommon colorants (mix chrome and rutile 50/50 with gerstley borate orfrit). A thin red iron or red earthenware slip or possibly a redterra sigillata on the foot or other exposed clay areas makes a nicecontrast if used on a white clay body.  Richard Burkett 1991. Othercolor possibilities: A nice dark blue green with: 2% cobalt carb + 3%chrome oxide + 2% black iron oxide added to the glaze.

All 3 glazes weretested on white and red stoneware, vertical and horizontal tiles.They were all fired in the bottom half of my Skutt to cone 6electric. The firing took approzimately 12 hours with a 1 hour soakat top temp. I added 2% rutile to all the glazes to test for colorresponse, and used OM4 ball clay (instead of bell dark). I wassomewhat surprised at how similar the glazes came out. The verticaltiles were virtually identical. All three were a soft gray opaquematt. My white stoneware has a little granular illmenite in it, andsmall spots bleed through. I double dipped 1/2 of each tile, and theglaze ran just a little. There was no discernable crazing. Thehorizontal tiles had noticable differences. These tiles were moremottled than the vertical ones, kind of like on oatmeal effect. Theoriginal glaze was a warmer gray than either of the 2 complexversions. The second complex version, where thick, was dry andsugary, and more silvery than either of the other 2. On all tiles,the red stoneware was more of a tan color than the white.

I have the answer, which is in Piepenburg's latestbook: The Spirit of Clay. (see p. 126 if you can get hold of it.) Iquote: The piece was first glaze fired to cone 5; re-glazed with athick application of his Mud Crack overglaze (50 % magnesiumcarbonate, 20 % neph. syenite, 20% Ferro Frit 3134, and 10% Gerstleyborate) and fired to cone 3. My suggestions are: try over a mattesurface glaze. You mentioned a slip. I think it would have to be avery vitreous slip to work. Depending on your kiln, I have had betterluck with a cone 2 in the sitter. or witness cone 3 at 9 oclock.. Butall depends on the glaze underneath. Also, thick application meansTHICK or the texture is absorbed into the glaze. If spraying themudcrack glaze, it is possible that it will crack and fall off theexisting fired glaze!!. submitted by: Bacia Edelman e-mail:medelman@facstaff.wisc.edu source for original recipe: RobertPipenburgGlaze name: Name 1Cone: 5 - 6Color: Testing: UntestedSurface: Firing: Ox or RedGlaze type: Ca BRecipe:Frit 3124	60.00Gerstley borate	10.00Flint	10.00EPK	10.00Whiting	10.00Comments: Glaze Type: Ca B.

It doesbetter if you do a controlled cooling as it is a crystalline glaze and needs theslow cool for the crystals to grow (fast cool will yield a chocolate browngloss).You have to do a line blend on this one to get it right as iron oxides arenever the same. I use Spanish red iron oxide. Generally increments of 1% RIO willbe fine. But, you really need to do the line blend to get the best red and tofully appreciate the range of colors in that small range of RIO additions.From Bill Buckner bbuckner@sodaglaze.comVariations --rio 11-17%Glaze name: Orange-Red BaseCone: 6Color: Orange-brownTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: Iron SaturateTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Custer feldspar	46.70Kaolin	4.00Bone ash	15.00Lithium carbonate	4.00Talc	16.90Flint	11.40Bentonite	2.00Red iron oxide	11.50Comments:From Glazes Cone 6 by Michael Bailey p. 89Glaze name: Orange/Brown gloss Kemp 8Cone: 6 - 7Color: dark orange/brownTesting: UntestedSurface: Shiny or GlossyFiring: Ox. or Red.Recipe:Potash feldspar	40.00Zinc oxide	4.00Dolomite	3.00Whiting	15.00Kaolin	5.00Silica	33.00Red iron oxide	4.00Comments:Shiny dark orange/brown Brian Kemp.

The firing took approzimately 12 hours with a 1 hour soakat top temp. I added 2% rutile to all the glazes to test for colorresponse, and used OM4 ball clay (instead of bell dark). I wassomewhat surprised at how similar the glazes came out. The verticaltiles were virtually identical. All three were a soft gray opaquematt. My white stoneware has a little granular illmenite in it, andsmall spots bleed through. I double dipped 1/2 of each tile, and theglaze ran just a little. There was no discernable crazing. Thehorizontal tiles had noticable differences. These tiles were moremottled than the vertical ones, kind of like on oatmeal effect. Theoriginal glaze was a warmer gray than either of the 2 complexversions. The second complex version, where thick, was dry andsugary, and more silvery than either of the other 2. On all tiles,the red stoneware was more of a tan color than the white.

It'sprobably bad for the environment too. Email me with questions as tohousehold performance, as that may be indicative of other problems.The badly crazed surfaces are not considered to be a continous-nonporous sanitary surfaces. Eric Hansen, Lawrence, Kansaswabi_sabi@mailexcite.com As I remember they were all quite nice. Butthese and about half a dozen other tests went into a bucket ofmystery glaze liner to which I added even more Custer, Kona F-4, EPK,then came in later with scoops of Gerstley and zircopax for a reallynice satin with no problems. I need to find a Mac up at KU that hasthe HyperglazeIIx on it with my files to reconstruct. But it may notbe worth it. That concept is simple if ya know how to use the programand maximize the feldspars, lithium, KNaO and get plenty of otherfluxes in each glaze. Also I did not know Clayart has 1995 archivesunder the subject: cone 6 chit-chat.

Or fired to 1200C at 50C/hr. I added 1%TiO2 which gives a nice blush of crystalline effects, without theyellowish orange you get from rutile. Where this glaze is thickerthough and right together with the crystals/bubbles, there's a foamytexture inside the glaze. I can tell because I fire on stilts andwhen the stilts come off, a little circular crust of glass stays onthe stilt pin and the interior of the glaze where the stilt pulledoff the surface looks like froth. Foam. (P.S. is this behavior anindicator of a fit problem?) So the glaze goes onto greenware andgets put in the kiln on stilts. Fired. Tons of what I thought werecrystals but maybe they really are bubbles, as revealed by the froth.The presence of some sharp-edged pinholes argues that my crystals arebubbles maybe. Conventional wisdom I: soak more or cool more slowly.Done that I: Goes up to temp at 60C/hr, soaks 25 minutes, cools at150C/hr to 900, then at 60C/hr to 700. If it gets any slower thanthat, won't I be a laughing stock? Conventional wisdom II: tryrefiring to convince yourself that it needs to soak some more. Donethat II: Refired a set of pieces. Foam is still there. Some of thesharp edged pinholes have closed up. I have used this same recipewith 8% rutile (lovely effect by the way if your rutile is finelyenough ground). It doesn't exhibit the same problem as far as I cansee. A few pinholes where quite thick but nothing like this. So. Isthis because titanium actually makes a glaze more refractory? I'mkinda puzzled about calculating how to make something melt moresmoothly. Especially since it already seems totally loaded up withmelter, all that boron.

A while back you toldme that the expansion for the PMSP-4 glaze was a little low. You sentme a revised version which had a slightly higher expansion. I thenlooked at Tony Hansen's 5-20 glaze and found it to be pretty close tomy PMSP-4. What range do you think the expansion should be in for acone 6 oxidation glaze? PMSP-4 Expansion coefficient: 68.0 x 10e-7per degree C Ron Roy's version of PMSP-4 Expansion coefficient: 71.1x 10e-7 per degree C Tony Hansen's 5-20's glaze Expansioncoefficient: 69.2 x 10e-7 per degree C In terms of my experiencefiring these glazes, I have found the PMSP to be water clear. Yourrevision to be mostly clear with bubbles only in areas of reliefwhere the glaze has pooled. The 5-20's glaze for me was cloudy. I'mwondering if Ron Wright is getting more bubbles because he is tryingto get a THICK clear? My clear gets a 4 second dip and I can't findany bubbles in it under a 1.5x magnifying glass. For anyone followingthis thread, all of the above glazes are given below. All are cone 6oxidation. My firing takes about 8-9 hours to bend a large cone 6 andthen I soak the kiln for another half hour to hour until cone 7 is at2 o'clock. I then turn all of the switches to medium for 3 hoursbefore shutting it off. The correct formula for Post's PMSP-4 is thisone. The one posted on the database is incorrect.

Or fired to 1200C at 50C/hr. Someone asked the otherday about the billions of tiny bubbles that formed the clouds in aglaze that was supposed to be clear. I've been wondering about asimilar phenomenon in a glaze that is clear to start with. I added 1%TiO2 which gives a nice blush of crystalline effects, without theyellowish orange you get from rutile. Where this glaze is thickerthough and right together with the crystals/bubbles, there's a foamytexture inside the glaze. I can tell because I fire on stilts andwhen the stilts come off, a little circular crust of glass stays onthe stilt pin and the interior of the glaze where the stilt pulledoff the surface looks like froth. Foam. (P.S. is this behavior anindicator of a fit problem?) So the glaze goes onto greenware andgets put in the kiln on stilts. Fired. Tons of what I thought werecrystals but maybe they really are bubbles, as revealed by the froth.The presence of some sharp-edged pinholes argues that my crystals arebubbles maybe. Conventional wisdom I: soak more or cool more slowly.Done that I: Goes up to temp at 60C/hr, soaks 25 minutes, cools at150C/hr to 900, then at 60C/hr to 700. If it gets any slower thanthat, won't I be a laughing stock? Conventional wisdom II: tryrefiring to convince yourself that it needs to soak some more. Donethat II: Refired a set of pieces. Foam is still there. Some of thesharp edged pinholes have closed up. I have used this same recipewith 8% rutile (lovely effect by the way if your rutile is finelyenough ground). It doesn't exhibit the same problem as far as I cansee. A few pinholes where quite thick but nothing like this. So. Isthis because titanium actually makes a glaze more refractory? I'mkinda puzzled about calculating how to make something melt moresmoothly. Especially since it already seems totally loaded up withmelter, all that boron.

The surface is very smooth to thetouch.  It would be a good glaze for color variations. We have done asmall amount of testing with mason stain additions and it seems torespond well to most colors, particularly the yellow.*How long have you been using this glaze? In a college studio setting for about a year.*Where is it used? Anne Arundel Community College*Where did this recipe come from? I have two versions of this glaze.  This is the best and I am notsure if it came from the Penland Pottery book or not.  I don't knowthe source of the other one.*What do you like most about this glaze? The reliability and the feel.*Is this glaze reliable? Yes, very.*Does this glaze tend to craze/crawl/pinhole/etc.? We have had some crawling when it is applied thickly or overlappedheavily with other glazes. Controlling the thickness is essential.*How do different firing temperatures/atmospheres affect the glaze? It seems to stand up well to temperature variations.  When it ishotter it will tend to go more translucent.*How does the glaze behave on different clay bodies? The color is pretty powerful.  Over a stoneware body in reduction itwill go a bit darker, and it will be brighter and bluer over a whitebody.*What consistency should the glaze be for pouring/dipping? A cream consistency, so that you can see the cutile of your fingerswhen a hand is dipped in the glaze.*How thickly should the glaze be applied to the pot? Medium, a full 3 second dip is adequate.*How does this glaze interact with other glazes? It breaks up nicely and goes to a navy blue when used with our clearglaze.*What is your kiln type and size? Most of our work with it has been in an Alpine 20 natural gas kiln.We have also used it in a 23" dia. L&L econo kiln.  The colors inoxidation are a bit lighter, and the surface is not as smooth.*How do you typically fire? The gas schedule is just 7.5 to 8 hours to reach cone 6.  We firebetween cone 6 and 7.  Reduction starts at cone 010, and continues tocone 6, with the dampers being opened gradually as the firing getscloser to completion, but we maintain reduction to the end. No soak.We close the dampers but don't close the burner ports.  We open thekiln 36 hours later.  It is usually still pretty warm a the top.*What is your water pH? very close to 7*GlazeBase Glaze* Submitted by: Rick Malmgren (RMalmgren@juno.com) Ice Cream Flavor: Bryer's Mint Chocolate Chip  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Glaze name: Purple Jeannie'sCone: 6Color: PurpleTesting: Surface: GlossFiring: OxidationGlaze type: Mid-fireTransparency: OpaqueRecipe:Nepheline syenite	18.00Frit 3134	14.00Whiting	20.00Kentucky OM #4	18.00Silica	30.00Chrome oxide	0.20Tin oxide	3.75Cobalt carbonate	0.60Comments:Clay Times Jan/Feb 05 p.55.

It only makes a littledifference. I do only tile, and don't spray this. I've spent the last3 years working on cone 5 iron red glazes, starting with Randy's Red,and I've found some things that work to make it redder. I started bytaking each ingredient, cutting it down, and gradually adding it backtill I had double the amount in the recipe. I found some adjustmentsthat work. Then I researched adding other ingredients in variousamounts, and found a couple that seem to help. My new recipe I callTowy Red, after my dog. He's a Welsh Springer Spaniel, and has spotsthis color. He's named after the River Towy in Wales (rhymes withHowie). Then I tried different irons. I tried black iron, yellowiron, and 5 different reds, including Spanish Red. I found that theredder it was before it was fired, the redder it would be after. Thebest I have found so far has been an iron from Pfizer that is brightred-orange raw. I'm almost out, and don't know where to get more. Anysuggestions? The Spanish Red I got from a local supplier, and it'searthy red-brown. I've been told that what I got was not real SpanishRed. Is this true? Where can I get the real stuff? To get the red,you need a lot of calcium, and almost as much, but not more,magnesium. All of these iron reds have a very high silica/ aluminaratio, at least 20 to 1, some as high as 100 to 1. Of course they runlike the Energizer Bunny, but I only use them on tile. submitted by:Paul Lewing e-mail: PJLewing@aol.comGlaze name: Red ValsCone: 5 - 6Color: tanTesting: Surface: Firing: oxidationRecipe:Flint	29.70EPK	4.95Feldspar	19.80Talc	13.86Gerstley borate	31.68Iron oxide	2.97Rutile	2.97Comments:Not really red.

I would never describe it as a foolproof glaze, but ifapplied with care, it's so beautiful that it just knocks out all thereliable competition. I bisque at ^06 and am now firing at ^6. I havegone to ^9, but that seems to present more problems with pinholingand crazing. Also, I wash the ash. I have also used the same recipewith unwashed ash. The difference is that I would describe theunwashed ash glaze as stony matt and the washed ash glaze as opaquesatin matt. Haven't tried this recipe at a lower temperature.

Weweighed out a 2000 gram batch. It should have turned out to be a deepglossy burgundy red; instead, to our horror, it turned out darkreddish-brown, but dry matt and somewhat orange-peeled. I firedagain, thinking it had underfired ... Same result. This leads me towonder if either: 1) My solution for weighing out large quantities onmy Ohaus Triple-Beam weigh scale is at fault: I compensate for thelight plastic bucket placed on the scale in lieu of the pan bysuspending a small bag of pennies and paperclips on one of the frontprongs then adjust to balance. How do the rest of you weigh out largebatches using the Triple Beam? or 2) Could there have been somethingwrong with the Red Iron Oxide? I say this because the finishedsurface is so rough and dry and bubbly/pebbly, it almost looks asthough the glaze was saturated with iron, which in my experienceusually acts as a flux rather than a refractory ingredient. I wouldreally appreciate feedback on both of these possibilities, as perhapsall the test resutls I have done using my own formulas might be basedon my own possibly misguided solution for weighing (meaning thatnoone else would be able to reproduce any of my formulas if I were toshare them) and/or also as I don't want to use this iron supply in myown formulas if it's bad. submitted by: Nancy Warren e-mail:nwarren@julian.uwo.caGlaze name: Rowe brownCone: 6Color: brownTesting: Surface: semi-glossFiring: Recipe:Colemanite	50.00EPK	20.00Flint	30.00Manganese dioxide	5.00Red iron oxide	10.00Comments:Hello Anne, This is a neat brown semi-gloss for cone 6.

(Sorry for the delay) It worksover the Amaco Reward Velvet Underglazes, including reds, purples,etc. I will post the original recipe and then add my revisions. OK.The above glaze crazed on my A.R.T. #135 porcelain at cone 6. Beingabsolutely non-technical, I stumbled in to the followingsubstitution: I substituted calcined kaolin (comercial name Glomax,from A.R.T.) for the EPK. I also substituted Amorphous Silica for theFlint. I don't use C.M.C. I do add Flocs...it settles out. It isglossy and very clear. My samples from two/three years ago still lookgood, no delayed crazing. I don't use it on anything, because I founda whole palette of glazes while I was looking for a good clear, andhave lost interest in underglaze decorating. The pursuit wasinteresting, though ;-) I found the Pemco Frit 626 through Trinitysupply in Texas. I do not know about substitutes. submitted by:Candice Roeder e-mail: CRoeder@worldnet.att.net source for originalrecipe: James ChappellGlaze name: Shaner RevisionCone: 5-6Color: Testing: Surface: Firing: Ox. or Red.Glaze type: Mid-fireRecipe:cuts	30.00Nepheline syenite	30.00Whiting	20.00Talc	4.00Comments:Variations --Red: + bone ash 6 + iron 4Gold: + rutile 4Glaze name: Shaner Revision 1Cone: 5 - 6Color: GoldTesting: UntestedSurface: Firing: ReductionGlaze type: Ca  AlMatt MidRoadRecipe:Custer spar	2424.00Nepheline Sye	2424.00Whiting	1616.00Talc	323.00Kaolin	727.00Bone ash	485.00Iron oxide	323.00Rutile	323.00Comments:Looks like Shaner Gold.

It works wonderfully..I mix up a 5 gallon pail of it,then put smaller amounts in jars and add mason stains to differentjars to get the colors i want - I really don't measure, just addenough by sight until it looks right. One of those small samplepackets (1/4 ounce?) usually does great in a cottage cheese containerfilled with the white slip. Then I brush the slip on green pots, letit dry overnight if it's humid summer in northern Wisconsin, or coverwith plastic overnight if the woodstove is on...the waiting makes thecarving through the slip give a nicer line I feel. Once my drawingsare done, I bisque, then cover with a clear glaze and fire to cone 7or 8. the nice thing about this slip recipe is that it is good forcones 6-11, and it's true because I've used it in my electric kiln at6 and my wood kiln at 12!

One might wish to substitutemagnesium carbonate for the barium especially for use on functionalware. SIGNIFICANT INGREDIENTS IN THE GLAZE gertsley borate is a flux,it contributes boron and sodium to the glaze and it encourages verystrong melts. Kaolin contributes silica and alumina and it has fewimpurities, is highly refractory, controls the glaxe flow and it isneutral in color but contributes to a mat surface. Lithium carbonateis a powerfull flux and it encourages shiny surfaces and producesglazes with strong visual textures. This glaze contains a great dealof lithium, such glazes may flake off of the ware and one should notuse more then 5%. Neph syn is a feldspar, it contributes silica,alumina and powerfull fluxes to the glaze. Tin is an opacifier. Zincis a flux and in moderate amounts it is a storng melter andencourages good glaze durability. This is a high alumina glaze whichshall have a rather modest glaze flow. It will be a soft white mattor a satin matt. Without barium it may be more towards the satin matttexture. Harold J.

I used zircopax. A very fine, strong, white glazewith a soft sheen. Opaque. I love the white color of this glaze.Since it turns to cement when it sits, I have started addingbentonite, which helps.

Here are a couple of standards from the Richmond Potters Club,and a few of my own formulation that have worked well in ^6oxidation. They aren't revolutionary (my exciting ones have thingslike barium in them, or are less predictable for a classroomsituation) but they have been reliable, and allow for some play. Theyall calculate out to well within the INSIGHT limit formulas formaturity at ^6. If anyone tests these and comes up with problems, newideas, good variations etc. could they let me know?

It only makes a littledifference. I do only tile, and don't spray this. I've spent the last3 years working on cone 5 iron red glazes, starting with Randy's Red,and I've found some things that work to make it redder. I started bytaking each ingredient, cutting it down, and gradually adding it backtill I had double the amount in the recipe. I found some adjustmentsthat work. Then I researched adding other ingredients in variousamounts, and found a couple that seem to help. My new recipe I callTowy Red, after my dog. He's a Welsh Springer Spaniel, and has spotsthis color. He's named after the River Towy in Wales (rhymes withHowie). Then I tried different irons. I tried black iron, yellowiron, and 5 different reds, including Spanish Red. I found that theredder it was before it was fired, the redder it would be after. Thebest I have found so far has been an iron from Pfizer that is brightred-orange raw. I'm almost out, and don't know where to get more. Anysuggestions? The Spanish Red I got from a local supplier, and it'searthy red-brown. I've been told that what I got was not real SpanishRed. Is this true? Where can I get the real stuff? To get the red,you need a lot of calcium, and almost as much, but not more,magnesium. All of these iron reds have a very high silica/ aluminaratio, at least 20 to 1, some as high as 100 to 1. Of course they runlike the Energizer Bunny, but I only use them on tile. submitted by:Paul Lewing e-mail: PJLewing@aol.comGlaze name: Tracy Wilson's ClearCone: 5 - 6Color: clearTesting: Surface: shinyFiring: Recipe:Nepheline syenite	45.00Colemanite	25.00Kaolin	15.00Silica	15.00Bentonite	3.00Comments:The clear was lovely over the white slip but pinholed majorly overthe blue.

Georgeous effect....flecks of gold in a translucentcaramel color. Some crazing. Suggest you test on vertical surfacestall enough to significantly test the running quality. Could reallymake a mess on a shelf. Also, a caution about the mixture. I foundthat once the ingredients are mixed it needs to be used right away.If allowed to sit unused for even two or three days, 6-sided crystalsbegin to grow. These could be a problem, altering the glaze and theway it performs. Enjoy. John Rodgers in Alabama inua@quicklink.netmore: Back in August, Veronica Shelford posted the following formulafor V's Tenmoku Gold (cone 6 ox) to Clayart She described it as herown variation on the Richmond (BC) Potters' Club Red Tenmoku andhaving gold flecks on a red-brown base. I tried it on a warm brownclay body and really like the results. For me, at ^6, it is a verydeep, glossy chocolate brown with gold flecks. Because ofunintentional uneven temps in subsequent firings, I have found thatat ^5 the glaze is rich, glossy brown with more dense patches of amore matt gold haze, and at ^7 the gold disappears and the result wasglossy dark brown with breaks of medium tan on high spots. The ^5 and^7 results were obtained after adding 5% flint to the originalformula to try to correct some flowing and crazing. Just thought thismight be of some interest to those experimenting with Tenmoku glazesin oxidation.

Thisglaze produced a misty affect, which I believe Eleanora Eden(?) wasafter some time ago. It was applied to Miller #15 Cone 6 Porcelainbisque. I fired to Cone 6 using an Orton Cone 7 centered in kilnsitter with no Guard Cones. The glaze was much as described by V.C.The semi-opacity produces a misty appearance over underglaze. Theunderglaze I used in the test was Duncan C154, Cobalt Navy Blue.After painting the UG onto the bisque, I re-fired to Cone 06. Theglaze was applied over this in 1 & 2 coats by dipping, then fired toCone 6. The underglaze showed through 1 or 2 coats with a bettercontrast under 2 coats. Lettering painted in underglaze onto thebisque showed through the glaze quite clearly. However, carving intothe porcelain (also stoneware) clay surface was completely orpartially obliterated under this glaze. If you carve designs onto apot which will be covered by this glaze, you'll need to take measuresnot to let the carved marks be blocked back out. (Remove or preventthe glaze from covering areas where you want the carving to show.)Wax resist is harder to work with for this glaze, so I'd considerscratching or scraping off unwanted glaze. Fired to maturity, theglaze didn't run back into letters created by scratching into the rawglaze. In fact, where the scratched-in letters appeared over the dk.blue UG, they showed up very clearly, retaining a crisp edge. Theystood out better against 2 coats (rather than 1) of glaze. This lookspromising as a handy way to work with lettering or linear design. Igot delayed crazing from this glaze over the Miller #15. None inevidence yet over Miller #55, which is a buff-white. stoneware, Cone6-9 (this clay body doesn't perform well in microwave ovens). Therealso was some slight cratering of the glaze on Miller #15 whereapplied thickly. When 2 light coats of this glaze were poured over 2light coats of Spinach Green, it was transmuted into an attractivesemi-matt, waxy Lettuce Green (voila- a vitreous tossed salad. Cometo think of it, I had one of those at Red Lobster not too long ago.There was lots of sand in it.). The base for Spinach Green,originally a Richard Behrens glaze, has been used by Peter King (seeCM 12/85, p.36). It has a wide Cone range, incl.

I didn't really like the result at cone 6with the gerstley, as it was a frosty transparent olive green (atcone 9 it was a RUNNY transparent olive green. Adding Manganese orcobalt to the Alberta slip would probably give a really nice black.What I left out in making this one was Gerstley 10 (Rob usesColemanite), but what I ended up with was a stony black with verytiny brown specks.

Some- times bright yellow, sometimes browner depends onmineral content of the ash which varies from wood to wood. Darker andmore opaque where thin goes to almost black. Yellow where thicker.Keep glaze thin or you will be scraping shelves. Becomes transparentyellowish brown and very fluid when thickly applied. The mid waythin/thick of application is mottled like a salt fired piece and issatin matte. But I got great reds, yellows, browns, blacks on pieceswhere it's thinner. To make tiny rivers of ash I make the same glazesubstituting Red Art for the Ochre and trail it on with a slip trailbulb. Caution: use rubber gloves with unwashed ash glazes or face thepossibility of contact dermatitis. It will mildly burn the skin. Ikeep Cornhuskers lotion and Hydrocortisone cream around the houseanyway. I layer it with a glossy, glassy glaze that by itself has itsown problems like keeping me up at night to the sound of loudlycooling and crazing *pings* I use a glaze with wood ash. I don't washthe ash, but I do screen it. The woodash has to be soft, white,fluffy. Not from a wood kiln! That kind is sintered and won't get thebest results. You can tell it will feel crispy at first. I'm nottaking responsibility for anyone using these glazes, etc. Somethingis probably toxic. They are examples of my research and they work outin formulation. Which is what they are examples of. So go formulateyour own non-toxic glazes, if that is possible.

Doesn't add to 100 because ofthe strontium/barium substitution, the bentonite, and the ash. Thismay be closer to cone 5 than cone 6 but seems to work over a range ofa couple cones. This is Zakin's GK base with 15% unwashed, mixedfireplace ashes, with strontium substituted for barium and superpaxfor opax. By itself over porcelain, the glaze is not particularlyinteresting. But other glazes on top of it run and drip and blendtogether nicely. I've found that if I glaze the lower 2/3 or 3/4 of apot with a well-behaved glossy glaze, brush a coat of this ZGK ashglaze on the top 1/3 or so and then brush or dip some third glaze ontop of the ash glaze, I get a nice pattern of runs that don't go offthe bottom of the pot onto the kiln shelf (usually). Different glazesgive different kinds of runs and bands of different glazes areinteresting too. The few times I tried a matte glaze on the bottom,the pots cracked. Could have been coincidence.
